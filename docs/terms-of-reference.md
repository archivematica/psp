**Date adopted**: 21 October 2020

## Background and Purpose

The Product Support Program is a membership-based venue for organizations that
are actively engaged in extending or customising Archivematica. The PSP helps
members reduce the costs of their Archivematica software development and better
manage the associated risks. Members will engage with other developer-users,
improve their understanding, and help shape discussions around development
practices and the technical architecture of the Archivematica project.

This program is not about governance of the Archivematica software project but
about ensuring that people who are developing Archivematica are making as much
sustainable progress as possible with the least amount of effort.

The program is designed to benefit organisations that are extending or
customising Archivematica for local use. Members will describe and coordinate
their development plans, with the intention of incorporating their
customisations and extensions into general public releases of Archivematica,
managed by Artefactual. The program aims to reduce the cost and effort required
to contribute code to the Archivematica project, for program members and the
entire Archivematica community.

The Product Support Program was initiated by Artefactual in December 2019. The
first official meeting was held on January 15, 2020.

## Mandate

The mandate of the Product Support Program is to improve and ensure the long
term, sustainable usefulness and value of Archivematica to members and the
entire global cultural memory community.

The PSP provides two primary mechanisms to fulfill its mandate. The first is a
forum to discuss the software development process. Members can describe problems
and obstacles they are experiencing, and help identify ways to improve
development practices, identify and reduce friction in development coordination,
and reduce technical debt, improve test coverage, and increase the visibility of
active and planned development work across the entire Archivematica community.

Secondly, the PSP has an advisory role, allowing members to share their plans
and ideas for software improvements, and receive feedback from other members and
from Artefactual. Crucially, this process will help distinguish between product
improvements, and customisations and extensions. Artefactual can then take
responsibility for ensuring the core Archivematica product evolves and improves
in a way that best meets common needs, and reduces the cost and risk of
integration with other software components.

In order to achieve these aims, PSP members will:

* Discuss and review the current Archivematica Technical Architecture, including
the interfaces and API, proposed innovations, and the long term vision of the
project.
* Describe their plans and current projects to write code for, or related to, Archivematica.
* Document a process for creating and maintaining a roadmap for Archivematica.
* Produce a collaborative list of development intentions from Members once every
90 days for the purpose of finding synchronicity between Member initiatives and
sharing information.
* Publish minutes and other documents to share development intentions and
efforts with the Archivematica community.
* Discuss pooling of resources toward aligned development activities.
* Contribute to Artefactual’s Product Vision for Archivematica and related
applications.

## Principles

Artefactual and the Members of the Product Support Program agree on the
following principles:

1. That participants want to see Archivematica be successful and sustainable as
a long-term digital preservation solution.
2. That Archivematica is more sustainable and successful if there is a wider
community of developers contributing to the codebase.
3. That Archivematica remain free and open in all senses. The Members of the
Product Support Program can guide and suggest changes in the development of
Archivematica but participation in the project is still open to all.
4. That Archivematica is more sustainable if the need to branch the code is
minimised and more successful if code quality is maintained.
5. That organizations who are actively developing code for Archivematica should
have a project-wide view of other major development efforts in order to minimize
the risk of redundancy.
6. That the minutes, papers and artefacts of this group will be open to all.

## Procedures

### Review

These Terms of Reference will be updated on an annual basis during the first
meeting of the calendar year.

### Meetings

#### Schedule

Meetings will be held quarterly in January, April, July, and October. The
January, April, and July meetings will be held via teleconference, hosted by
Artefactual.

The October meeting will be an extended in-person meeting, hosted by one of the
Members or by Artefactual. The location will be decided by consensus.

“Off-schedule” meetings may be organized as needed. These off-schedule meetings
could be continuations of the quarterly meeting, or they could serve other
purposes, such as informational webinars on new initiatives by group members.
Off-schedule meetings will be recorded for Members to watch later, if requested.

Meeting reminders will be sent to the mailing list one week before the meeting.

#### Attendance

There is no limit on the number of people who can attend each meeting per member
organization. It is strongly encouraged that cross-disciplinary teams attend,
including technical staff (developers and systems administrators) who work with
Archivematica.

While regular attendance of meetings ensures the success of the program, it is
understood that occasionally members may need to send their regrets. Please send
regrets by responding to the meeting reminder sent to the mailing list.

While it is to everyone's benefit if members can send at least one delegate to
every meeting, it is understandable if regrets need to be sent if no one is
available.

#### Details

* Meetings will be organized by Artefactual and Artefactual will act as the
secretariat for the program.
* Artefactual will put out a call for agenda items one month before the meeting.
All Members are welcome to contribute agenda items.
* Artefactual will prepare the agenda and send it out one week before the
meeting.
* Online meetings will be held via Zoom or another teleconferencing system
hosted by Artefactual.
* Artefactual will take minutes and send the minutes out for review after the
meeting.
* Reviewed minutes will be posted in the Archivematica PSP GitHub repository.
