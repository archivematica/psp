The Archivematica Product Support Program is a venue for organizations that are
actively developing Archivematica to engage with other developer-users, reduce
their own risks, improve their understanding, and help shape discussions around
development practices and the technical architecture of the Archivematica
project. It is organized by [Artefactual Systems,
Inc.](https://www.artefactual.com/).

This program is not about governance but about ensuring that people who are
developing Archivematica are making as much progress as possible with the least
amount of effort.

The Product Support Program was initiated by Artefactual in December 2019. The
first official meeting was held on January 15, 2020.

This site contains meeting minutes and other documents for the Archivematica
Product Support Program.
